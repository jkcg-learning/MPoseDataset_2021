<h1 align="center">  MPOSE2021 <br> A Dataset for Short-Time Human Action Recognition
</h1>


This repository contains the MPOSE2021 Dataset for short-time Human Action Recognition (HAR). 

<p align="center">

</p>

MPOSE2021 is developed as an evolution of the MPOSE Dataset [1-3]. It is made by human pose data detected by 
[OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) [4] and [Posenet](https://github.com/google-coral/project-posenet/tree/master/models) [11]
on popular datasets for HAR, i.e. Weizmann [5], i3DPost [6], IXMAS [7], KTH [8], UTKinetic-Action3D (RGB only) [9] and UTD-MHAD (RGB only) [10], alongside original video datasets, i.e. ISLD and ISLD-Additional-Sequences [1].
Since these datasets had heterogenous action labels, each dataset labels were remapped to a common and homogeneous list of 20 actions.

This repository allows users to directly access the POSE dataset (Section A.) or generate RGB and POSE data for MPOSE2021 in a python-friendly format (Section B.). 
Generated RGB and POSE sequences have a number of frames between 20 and 30. 
Sequences are obtained by cutting the so-called "precursor videos" (videos from the above-mentioned datasets), with non-overlapping sliding windows.
Frames where OpenPose/PoseNet cannot detect any subject are automatically discarded. Resulting samples contain one subject at the time, performing a fraction of a single action. 

Overall, MPOSE2021 contains 15429 samples, divided into 20 actions performed by 100 subjects. 
The overview of the action composition of MPOSE2021 is provided in the following image:

</p>

## A. Access POSE Data Only
To get only MPOSE2021 POSE data, install our light and simple [pip package](https://pypi.org/project/mpose/)

```
pip install mpose
```

And use the MPOSE class to download, extract, and process POSE data (Openpose/PoseNet).

```python
# import package
import mpose

# initialize and download data
dataset = mpose.MPOSE(pose_extractor='openpose', 
                      split=1, 
                      transform='scale_and_center', 
                      data_dir='./data/')

# print data info 
dataset.get_info()

# get data samples (as numpy arrays)
X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test = dataset.get_dataset()
```

Check out the package documentation and [this Colab Notebook Tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_v3DYwgZPMCiELtgiwMRYxQzcYGdSWFH?usp=sharing) for more hands-on examples <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_v3DYwgZPMCiELtgiwMRYxQzcYGdSWFH?usp=sharing"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>.

## B. Generate RGB and POSE Data
### Requirements
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The following requirements are needed to generate RGB data for MPOSE2021 (tested on Ubuntu):
  * around 340 GB free disk space (330 GB for archives and temporary files, 10 GB for VIDEO, RGB and POSE data)
